					My name is Liam, I am a transfer with a major in film and digital media, I came from a community
					college called Palomar in San Marcos. My highlights from there were the media classes and
					screenprinting. In screenprinting, a highlight was I made custom playing cards themed around me and
					my friends on PVC cards. At home, I have 3 cats: a black cat named Prince, a bangle named Merlin,
					and a tabby named Momo.
